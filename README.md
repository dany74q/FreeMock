C++ Free Function Mocker

While dealing with legacy codebases, and in the process of refactoring them,
I've tackled a need to mock free functions more easily.
That being of course a temporary solution, before you make the code more testable.

FreeMock can be of use to mock those highly used, untestable and scary-to-change free functions.

Look at the usage.cpp file for a usage example.
